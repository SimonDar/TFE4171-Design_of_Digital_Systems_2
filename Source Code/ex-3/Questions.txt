What outputs does the tool produce?

Question 3.1.2: Where is the bug?
The "bug" that failes is because it is formal verification. 
With formal verification, it will try to find senarios that fail. 
and because it is able to find these at behavior2. it will show fail(1). 
the (1) indicates that the fail accoured one clock cycle from the reset.
